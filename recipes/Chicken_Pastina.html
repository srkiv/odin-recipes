    <p>Chef John's chicken pastina is like a big, warm hug from an Italian grandma, a comfort food that will, quite literally, change your mood. You can make this simple soup with a fortified broth if you have the time, or simply use off-the-shelf chicken broth for the 15-minute version.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups prepared chicken broth</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup stelline (star-shaped) pastina, or other pastina such as acini di pepe</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (1 1/2 ounces by weight)</li>
        <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring broth to a simmer over medium-high heat. Taste; season with salt if needed. </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, and stir in pastina. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 seconds less than the package directions, 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn off heat, and stir in black pepper, butter, and grated cheese. Stir constantly until butter disappears. </li>
        <li>Ladle pastina into hot bowls, top with more freshly ground black pepper and Parmigiano Reggiano, and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
